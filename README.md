# Asteroid-Impact

This algorithm calculates the energy dissipated when an asteroid hits the earth
I used meters because that is the standard international unit of length (except for speed)
The mass is calculated by multiplying the density by the volume (the width times length times height)
The kinetic energy on impact is the mass times the speed
The rate of dissipation is the kinetic energy divided by the time it takes for the asteroid to hit the earth, which is the height divided by the speed
